## Introduction
Linux is one of the most popular and widely-used operating systems in the world. This guide will help you understand its history, components, and help you choose a distribution that fits your needs.

## History
Linux came to be in 1991, but to understand its origins, we need to go back to 1969 when Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie of Bell Laboratories developed the UNIX operating system. It was later rewritten in C to make it more portable and eventually became a widely used operating system.

The kernel is the most important piece in the operating system. It allows the hardware to talk to the software.

During this time other efforts such as BSD, MINIX, etc were developed to be UNIX-like systems. However, one thing that all these UNIX-like systems had in common was the lack of a unified kernel.

Then in 1991, a young fellow named Linus Torvalds started developing what we now know today as the Linux kernel.

## What is GNU?
GNU is an operating system that is free softwareâ€”that is, it respects users' freedom. The name "GNU" is a recursive acronym for "GNU's Not Unix." "GNU" is pronounced g'noo, as one syllable, like saying "grew" but replacing the r with n.

The program in a Unix-like system that allocates machine resources and talks to the hardware is called the "kernel." GNU is typically used with a kernel called Linux. This combination is the GNU/Linux operating system. GNU/Linux is used by millions, though many call it "Linux" by mistake.

## Components of a Linux System
The term Linux is actually quite a misnomer, since it actually refers to the Linux kernel. However, many distributions use the Linux kernel and therefore are commonly known as Linux operating systems.

A Linux system is divided into three main parts:

1. **Hardware** - This includes all the hardware that your system runs on as well as memory, CPU, disks, etc.
2. **Linux Kernel** - As we discussed above, the kernel is the core of the operating system. It manages the hardware and tells it how to interact with the system.
3. **User Space** - This is where users like yourself will be directly interacting with the system.

## Popular Linux Distributions

### Debian
Debian is an operating system composed entirely of free and open-source software. It's widely known and has been in development for over 20 years. There are three branches that you can use: Stable, Testing and Unstable.

### RHEL
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (commonly referred to as RHEL) is developed by Red Hat. RHEL has strict rules to restrict free re-distribution although it still provides source code for free.

### Ubuntu - The GOAT
Ubuntu is a great choice for a beginner who wants to get into Linux. Ubuntu offers ease of use and a great user interface experience that has led to its wide adoption. It's widely used and supported and is most like other operating systems like OSX and Windows in terms of usability.

### Fedora
Backed by Red Hat, Red Hat Enterprise Linux branches off Fedora, so think of Fedora as an upstream RHEL operating system. Eventually RHEL will get updates from Fedora after thorough testing and quality assurance. Think of Fedora as an Ubuntu equivalent that uses a Red Hat backend instead of Debian.

*Note -> There are many other Linux distributions available, but these are among the most popular ones.*
